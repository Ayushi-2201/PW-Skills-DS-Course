        "\n",
        "\"\"\"Routing in Flask refers to the mechanism that maps incoming web requests (specifically, their URLs) to the Python functions responsible\n",
        "for handling those requests and generating responses. It essentially acts as a dispatcher, determining which piece of code should execute\n",
        "based on the URL path the user visits in their browser or that an API client requests.\n",
        "\n",
        "Core Components:\n",
        "    URL Rule: This is the path part of a URL (e.g., /, /about, /users/<username>) that the application listens for.\n",
        "\n",
        "    View Function: This is a regular Python function decorated with Flask's routing capabilities. It takes the incoming request data (if any), performs\n",
        "                  necessary logic (e.g., interacts with a database, processes data), and returns a response (typically HTML, JSON, or a redirect).\n",
        "\n",
        "    @app.route() Decorator: This is Flask's primary tool for defining routes. The decorator is placed directly above a view function definition.\n",
        "                            It takes the URL rule as its first argument.\n",
        "\n",
        "How it Works:\n",
        "\n",
        "When a Flask application starts, it builds a mapping (often called a URL map) of all the URL rules defined using @app.route() decorators to their\n",
        "corresponding view functions. When the web server running the Flask application receives an HTTP request, Flask consults this URL map.\n",
        "\n",
        "  It matches the requested URL path against the registered URL rules.\n",
        "  If a match is found, Flask invokes the associated view function.\n",
        "  The view function executes its logic.\n",
        "  The return value of the view function is converted into an HTTP response and sent back to the client (e.g., the user's browser).\n",
        "  If no matching rule is found, Flask typically returns a 404 Not Found error.\n",
        "\n",
        "Key Features of Flask Routing:\n",
        "\n",
        "  HTTP Methods: By default, routes only respond to GET requests. You can specify which HTTP methods (like POST, PUT, DELETE) a route should handle\n",

        "    pass\n",
        "\n",
        "\"\"\"Dynamic Routing (Variable Rules): Flask allows parts of the URL to be variable. These variable parts are specified using angle brackets\n",
        "                (e.g., <variable_name>). The value captured from the URL is automatically passed as an argument to the view function.\n",
        "              Converters can be used to specify the expected data type (e.g., <int:post_id>, <string:username>).\"\"\"\n",

        "# 40. What are Flask templates, and how are they used in web development?\n",
        "\n",
        "\"\"\"Flask templates are files, typically written in HTML, that contain the structure and presentation logic for the user interface of a web application.\n",
        "They allow developers to separate the application's backend logic (written in Python) from its frontend presentation (written in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript).\n",
        "This separation is a key principle in web development, known as Separation of Concerns, which enhances maintainability, readability, and collaboration.\n",
        "\n",
        "Purpose and Role:\n",
        "  Instead of embedding large blocks of HTML directly within Python code (which quickly becomes unmanageable), Flask uses a template engine\n",
        "  to process these template files. Flask's default template engine is Jinja2, a powerful and widely used engine known for its flexibility\n",
        "  and expressive syntax.\n",
        "\n",
        "Templates are used to:\n",
        "  Generate Dynamic Content: They allow embedding dynamic data passed from the Python view function into the static HTML structure.\n",
        "                            For example, displaying a user's name, a list of products, or search results.\n",

        "                            enabling dynamic rendering based on data or conditions.\n",
        "\n",
        "  Promote Reusability: Features like template inheritance allow developers to create a base layout template\n",
        "                      (containing common elements like headers, footers, navigation) and have other specific page templates extend this base,\n",

        "  Template Files: Inside the templates folder, developers create files with .html extensions (e.g., index.html, user_profile.html).\n",
        "\n",
        "  Jinja2 Syntax: Within these HTML files, special Jinja2 syntax is used:\n",
        "      {{ variable_name }}: Used to print the value of a variable passed from the view function.\n",
        "      {% control_structure %} ... {% endstructure %}: Used for control flow statements like if, for, block, extends.\n",
        "      {# comment #}: Used for comments within the template that are not rendered in the final HTML.\n",
        "\n",
        "  Rendering Templates: In the Flask view function, instead of returning a simple string, the render_template() function (imported from flask) is used. This function takes the name of the template file (relative to the templates directory) as its first argument, and any subsequent keyword arguments are passed as variables accessible within the template.\n",
